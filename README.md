About Albums
============
This is a React Native application that displays a list of Taylor Swift albums that are available for sale on Amazon. 
Users can view these albums and click "Buy Now" if they wish to purchase a certain album. 
Upon clicking the "Buy Now" button, the user will be taken to the album sales page on Amazon where they can finish the transaction if they wish to do so.
I created this application by following along Stephen Grider's course on Udemy "The Complete React Native and Redux Course".
